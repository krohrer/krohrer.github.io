Iâ€™ve pushed a new version of the code. The code to dump s-expressions
did not handle references correctly, but it should now.

Maybe next time, I should prove the correctness using [Coq]. But then I
would not be writing new code, would I?

Ah, what a dilemma between theoretical exactness and practical
application. I wonder if Haskell will bridge that gap elegantly. We
never really had the time to get aquainted.
