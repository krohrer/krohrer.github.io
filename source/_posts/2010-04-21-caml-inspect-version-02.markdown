I’ve pushed a new version of the Caml-library to github, and I must
say, I'm really starting to like this whole open-source thing. It's
quite exciting. Amongst the changes are an updated `README` (usage
instructions), documentation using ocamldoc (`make htdoc`), and
packaging using the `-pack` option of the OCaml compiler. And easier
installation with make using the new install/uninstall targets.

The next step will be to host the project on
http://forge.ocamlcore.org/, so it has more exposure to the intended
target audience. I’ve already registered the project as
caml-inspect. I am currently awaiting approval from the site admins.
