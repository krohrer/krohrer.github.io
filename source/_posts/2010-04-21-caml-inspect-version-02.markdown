<div class='post'>
I've pushed a new version of the Caml-library to github, and I must say, I'm really starting to like this whole open-source thing. It's quite exciting. Amongst the changes are an updated README (usage instructions), documentation using ocamldoc (<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">make htdoc</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">)</span>, and packaging using the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">-pack</span> option of the OCaml compiler. And easier installation with make using the new <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">install/uninstall</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;targets.</span><br /><br />The next step will be to host the project on&nbsp;http://forge.ocamlcore.org/, so it has more exposure to the intended target audience. I've already registered the project as caml-inspect. I am currently awaiting approval from the site admins.</div>
