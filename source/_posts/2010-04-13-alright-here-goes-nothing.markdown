Yeah, well...

The time has come for me to expose myself and my interests to the
whole world.

<!--more-->

Just sitting in the proverbial basement and hacking the nights away,
absorbing knowledge (well, mostly just surfing the
[internet](http://welcometointernet.org)[^dont-click] ;-) and never sharing any
output with the world does not cut it for me anymore, I guess.

I will still enjoy spending the occasional sleepless night slouched in
front of my warmly glowing monitor, with the cursor eagerly blinking
while Emacs patiently waits for my input. However, as of this day, I
will also try to share some of my ideas and thoughts with the rest of
the world (or at least the miniscule part of it that might be
interested in what I have to say).

That's all for now. More to follow.
